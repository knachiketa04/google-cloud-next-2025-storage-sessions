# Workload optimized data protection for mission-critical enterprise apps - Key Takeaways & Insights

*Session at Google Cloud Next 2025*

## Session Recap
This session explored Google Cloud's comprehensive portfolio for protecting mission-critical enterprise applications, covering strategies for high availability, disaster recovery, backup, and ransomware protection, including solutions like Hyperdisk, Google Cloud Backup, and a real-world case study with Blackline.

## Key Takeaways
* Google Cloud provides a spectrum of data protection options, including Hyperdisk Balanced HA for RPO=0 cross-zone availability, Hyperdisk Async Replication for cross-region DR, Instant Snapshots for rapid recovery, and Google Cloud Backup for managed, ransomware-resilient backups.
* Hyperdisk Instant Snapshots offer near-instantaneous (seconds) creation and restore times, independent of disk size, enabling rapid recovery from operational errors or bad upgrades.
* Google Cloud Backup Vaults provide immutable, indelible storage with enforced retention, securing backups against ransomware and malicious deletion attempts.
* Blackline transitioned their Microsoft SQL Server FCI clusters from Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) to Hyperdisk Balanced MultiWriter, achieving ~33% cost savings, eliminating 2x storage overhead, and simplifying operations.

## My Perspective / "Spin"
* In real-world production environments, data protection strategies vary widely; there's no single 'one-size-fits-all' solution. Customers typically determine their optimal approach by working backward from specific business requirements, SLAs, and recovery guidelines. Google Cloud's portfolio allows for this tailored selection based on workload needs.
* For workloads running on GCE, Google Cloud Backup and DR Service, particularly with Backup Vault, offers a compelling path towards consolidated and simplified management. This integrated experience is gradually expanding to other services, like Cloud SQL.
* For use cases demanding the lowest RPO and RTO, especially around disaster recovery, customers will increasingly leverage Google Cloud's foundational storage primitives. Hyperdisk Instant Snapshots, Hyperdisk Balanced HA, and Hyperdisk Async Replication are key enablers for building these robust, high-performance solutions.
